Welcome to the home of |HGamer3D| a toolset for Haskell 3D game programming. On the following pages you will find an introduction how to use it and some details to specific topics. |HGamer3D| is not ready for real world use, it is currently an experimental toy. So you might ask, what is the strategy behind this project, what is the future of |HGamer3D|? First, have a look yourself, starting and exploring |HGamer3D| is easy and does not consume too much time. And it is fun to use Haskell for playing with 3D technologies. Then, although my time for this project will be certainly limited in the foreseeable future, the tooling has developed up to a point where creation of additional functionality can be done by others, also. What I mean with that is, that I follow a strategy to simplify hurdles for contribution. This is the reason for having designed a toolbox for binding generation, which is different from what you might have seen before and from a first view might be strange. But believe me, the goal is to open the doors for everybody, even with limited time, to extend the functionality. So |HGamer3D| uses a self-developed binding technology paired with a free game library (Urho3D if you are curious).

I have a small request for you, the reader. Please don't be shy to e-mail me, if you encounter any difficulties in using |HGamer3D| according to the guides below. The e-mail address for this is: uotbw@hgamer3d.org.
