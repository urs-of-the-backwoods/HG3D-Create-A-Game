Using Haskell - the famous functional programming language - for game creation should be fun and ideally suited to explore functional programming. 

This website and the |HGamer3D| library will help you with that. It is all about simple and fun game programming with Haskell, learning step by step and putting a focus on how to do it. The library is open source and works on Linux, Windows and OS X. I am myself on the road to use this vehicle to get a better grasp of Haskell.

And now, start reading and coding with |HGamer3D|.
