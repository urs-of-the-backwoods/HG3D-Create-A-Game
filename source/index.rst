Using Haskell - the famous functional programming language - for game creation should be fun and ideally suited to learn both, game programming and functional programming. 

This website and the |HGamer3D| library will help you with that. It is all about simple and fun game programming with Haskell, learning step by step and putting a focus on how to do it. The library is open source and works on Linux, Windows and OS X. 

Current features are:

- 3D Graphics & Materials
- Sound
- Key and Mouse Input
- GUI
- Easy to setup and use
