Literature
----------

As introduction to the Haskell programming language, very good books 
are in print and in addition tutorials and papers are available to a large extend
on the internet. As a basics course, you might consider the following literature:

	* *Programming in Haskell* from Graham Hutton [Hutton]_ the reference for an introduction to Haskell. Start 
	  with this one.

	* *Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!* from Miran Lipovaca [LYAHGG]_ is very popular on the Web. It contains 
	  great introductions to the basic concepts of Functors, Applicative Functors, Monoids and finally Monads.
	  
	* *The Haskell School of Expression: Learning Functional Programming through Multimedia* from Paul Hudack [Hudack]_. 
	  Contains a classic introduction to functional reactive programming.
	  
	* *Typeclassopedia* from Brent Yorgey [TCLP]_, an overview on the *zoo* of typeclasses.

	* *School of Haskell* from FPComplete [SOH]_. The company provides some very good introductionary texts to Haskell topics.
