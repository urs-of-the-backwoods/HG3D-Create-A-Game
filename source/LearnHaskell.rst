Learn Haskell
#############

The road to Haskell can be long and windy and people all over the world learning it are on completely different stages of development. There is very good introductory material and excellent "top-notch" material from research. Somehow the middle ground is missing and there is a debate how to cross the chasm from beginner to master level.

Let me give you the plan I made for myself, it is not clear, if it is a good one, though.

Start
-----

First take a basic textbook and learn and practice the basic syntax. A good reference one is *Programming in Haskell* from Graham Hutton [Hutton]_. It should get you pretty far for all your needs on the basics and a little further.

The time will come where each starter will struggle on functional concepts, mostly together with a struggle to understand the basic typeclasses like Functor, Monad and so on. Here a great resource which helped me a lot and still does is *Learn You A Haskell for Great Good* from Miran Lipovaca [LYAHGG]_. It is also available free on the Web and very popular.

.. note:: Since |HGamer3D| is written by a novice, the API is not highly complex but instead quite simple. With a "Start" knowledge level you should be able to use it.

Practice
--------

Now practice is needed and for this you need to master do notation and Monads. At a not so deep level but just to get you going with IO and the more elementary typeclasses. Therefore I included a short note on this later on. Also practice understanding library interfaces to advance your skills to a more productive state. I'm still not comfortable with most of the important library interfaces (API's) I need to confess.

Advance
-------

Advancing now to the final stages of mastering Haskell is the most tricky one. For advanced concepts, good tutorials are not so easy to find and understand, but there is a nice post on that from Gabriel Gonzales [GGAHT]_. Based on this my personal plan at least looks like that:

.. _`post`: http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/03/introductions-to-advanced-haskell-topics.html

- master typeclasses, just the basic functor contains a lot of abstraction, understand it.
- go step by step and learn the content of the tutorials in the post mentioned above.

This should bring me pretty far, I hope. I will tell you here on the progress, if there is some.
